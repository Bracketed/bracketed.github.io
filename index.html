                  <p class="dText" style="font-size: 120%;">We give you a very warm welcome to Bracketed!</p>
                  <p class="dText" style="font-size: 120%;">This is a bot made to remove the fact you need more then one bot to moderate your server, create tickets, play games, listen to music, create applications of view anything roblox-related. We made this bot to create ease in server moderation and much more! This was built by two extremely bored developers with high hopes to get big on the Discord platform.</p>
                  <p class="dText" style="font-size: 120%;">Bracketed was intended to be built for a community server called Armodia Systems LTD, however some parts of the bot were and are still built for that server. For example the /get-product, /get-audio and /get-preview commands are still around for that server in particular! (And no we will not make this for all servers unless you are using /product for your roblox product hub.)</p>

                  <a id="our-history"><h2 class="disText" style="font-size: 200%;">Our History</h2></a>
                  <p class="dText" style="font-size: 120%;">Bracketed was originally built for the convenience of Armodia, since ticket tool was not enough for us and absolutely nobody had money in their pockets to pay for the thing. So we made our first version of Bracketed, Armodia Support. This bot was based on something one of the owners of bracketed had found on github while doing a google search for 'discord ticket tool github rep' obviously it was not the best of quality. So along comes Armodia Support V2, this time it was built custom apart from the fact it was still using the same system to track tickets. Still not the best however and it was still far too buggy! The server was also taking a beating since the bot was breaking so hard we had to begin making our server management remote and partly automated. (We are still using the same server he's doing much better now :) ) After a while the bot was becoming older and was in need of another big update, so we updated it to DiscordJS V13 what made everything far more easier to use and manage. Error wise it was doing better too! Until recently where it starts crashing in the middle of the night for a very unknown reason. So DylanK decided to make three more bots, this was Armodia Support V3 and DylanK-Activities. However the third bot was never released and was barely started, so the rest of that bot was added into Bracketed later on. So a short amount of time passes and Dylan's bored again. So he begins on bracketed intending on using the Sapphire Framework to begin learning typescript, then found it too hard and decided he wanted to build the bot just using DiscordJS V13. Then midway starting it, he receives a message from the now Co-Creator of Bracketed, Jakisall, saying that DiscordJS V14 had been released! So he got to work trying to fix things up to the new version of DiscordJS and due to his lack of typescript knowledge he inevitably failed in doing so. So Jakisall was called back and was asked to help, he gladly accepted this invitation and the very first version of Bracketed was born, 'DylanK-Systems'. This was then later changed more times to the following, 'Azurus' and 'Aurora Systems'. Then was finalised by DylanK as Bracketed. He also made the first version of our logo what uses discord's two primary colours, Blurple and Black. The green was added to spice things up and ended up looking good in the final version of the logo. So that brings us up to now! DylanK and Jakisall are the only two developers/owners working on Bracketed side by side, and hoping to get big on the discord platform...</p>
